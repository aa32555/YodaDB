	;I wake up every evenin'
 	;With a big smile on my face
 	;And it never feels out of place
 	;And you're still probably workin'
 	;At a nine to five pace
 	;I wonder how bad that tastes
 	;When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
 	;When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
 	;Now, where's your picket fence, love?
 	;And where's that shiny car?
 	;And did it ever get you far?
 	;You never seemed so tense, love
 	;I've never seen you fall so hard
 	;Do you know where you are?
 	;And truth be told, I miss you (I miss you)
 	;And truth be told, I'm lyin'
 	;When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
 	;When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
 	;If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
 	;Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
 	;Hope it gives you hell
 	;Tomorrow you'll be thinkin' to yourself
 	;Yeah, where'd it all go wrong?
 	;But the list goes on and on
 	;And truth be told, I miss you (I miss you)
 	;And truth be told, I'm lyin'
 	;When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
 	;When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
 	;If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
 	;Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
 	;Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
 	;You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
 	;And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
 	;With the sad, sad look that you wear so well
 	;When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
 	;When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
 	;If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
 	;Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
 	;When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (hope it gives you hell)
 	;When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (hope it gives you hell)
 	;When you hear this song and you sing along, but you never tell (but you never tell)
 	;Then you're the fool, I'm just as well, hope it gives you hell (hope it gives you hell)
 	;When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell (hope it gives you hell)
 	;You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell

 	;Viva Las Vengeance
 	;Song by Panic! At The Disco 
 	;Pyramid of ones, kids with loaded guns
 	;Plugged on a power strip (power strip)
 	;I'm already dead, woodstock in the shed
 	;I'm so out of it (out of it)
 	;Someone did me wrong, stole my favorite song
 	;Yes, it really hurt (really hurt)
 	;Stepped on every chord, fell on every sword
 	;Yes, Excalibur (Excalibur)
 	;I don't wanna be a diva
 	;I just wanna be free
 	;On a sofa with Sativa
 	;Living the dream
 	;Shut up and go to bed
 	;She said, 'viva las vengeance'
 	;Shut up and go to bed
 	;She said, 'viva las vengeance'
 	;Hacking at my feed, act like you are me
 	;No one really cares (really cares)
 	;Nothing's really real, no one really feels
 	;Nothing to declare (to declare)
 	;I don't wanna be anonymous
	;But, I don't wanna be you
	;In a city full of promises
	;Nothing rings true
	;Shut up and go to bed
	;She said,'viva las vengeance'
	;Shut up and go to bed
	;She said, 'viva las vengeance'
	;Giving up the key to paint a masterpiece
	;What am I doing here?
	;Stuck here in the weeds
	;On a road that leads
	;To nowhere, to nowhere, to nowhere, to nowhere
	;To nowhere, to nowhere, to nowhere, to nowhere
	;Shut up and go to bed
	;Viva Las Vengeance
	;Shut up and go to bed
	;Viva Las Vengeance
	;Shut up and go to bed
	;Viva Las Vengeance
	;Shut up and go to bed
	;She said, 'viva las vengeance'
	;Shut up and go to bed
	;She said,'viva las vengeance'
	;Every moment is a replay
	;I'm being buried alive
	;Didn't wanna kill the DJ
	;But it can't hurt to try
